Measures the shape properties of the object boundaries and displays the curvature.

Vectorized and compacted/concised a complicated codebase by Dr. Preetham Manjunatha.

Thanks to Dr. Meghan Driscoll who kindly shared her code for academic purpose.

Important note: This code initially used a parfor to speed up the things. Now it has been vectorized for fast calculations.
